# Simple article type site

## Three functional pages for home (all articles), single article view and author info access from articles.

//Unfinished for now:
* Nonexisten CSS and proper user inteface

Functionality this project has:
* Home page allows you to see placeholder images, titles and associated links to full article
* Single article page with functional homepage button, placeholder image display and full text connected to said title
* On article page there is also comment section with all comments, titles and users emails
* Also while in single artical view you can click on authors username to check his profile
* Some of the basic functions also can be called from console, for more info type `php console.php` in terminal
* All above is also cached localy for 100 seconds
* MVC, Interface and Repository/Service pattern were properly implemented
